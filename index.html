  <!-- <h2>The root problem</h2>
  <h2>with conventional currency</h2>
  <h2>is all the trust that’s required to make it work. </h2>
  <h2>The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency...</h2>
  <h2>Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically... </h2>
  <h2>We have to trust them with our privacy, </h2>
  <h2>trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. </h2>
  

   <h2> A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and <em>trust</em> was <em>no longer required</em>. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.</h2>

		<h2><strong>It’s time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless...</strong></h2>
